# **Title: Clustering-Assignment**
In this assignment we had to perform different clustering algorithms using different pre-processing techniques with different numbers of clusters on different evaluation parameters.

I have used Pycaret in this assignment.

The dataset that I have used is Iris Dataset.

The three clustering techniques I have used are:<br>
<br>
1. K means Clustering<br>
2. Hierarchical Clustering<br>
3. DBSCAN<br>
<br>
The Parameters I have taken are:<br>
1. Silhouette<br>
2. Calinski-Harabasz<br>
3. Davies-Bouldin<br>
<br>
The Pre-Processing techniques I have used are:<br>
1. Normalization<br>
2. PCA (Principle Component Analysis)<br>
3. Transform<br>
