# **Title: Clustering-Assignment**
In this assignment we had to perform different clustering algorithms using different pre-processing techniques with different numbers of clusters on different evaluation parameters.

I have used Pycaret in this assignment.

The dataset that I have used is Iris Dataset.

The three clustering techniques I have used are:

1.K means Clustering
2.Hierarchical Clustering
3.DBSCAN

The Parameters I have taken are:
1.Silhouette
2.Calinski-Harabasz
3.Davies-Bouldin

The Pre-Processing techniques I have used are:
1.Normalization
2.PCA (Principle Component Analysis)
3.Transform
